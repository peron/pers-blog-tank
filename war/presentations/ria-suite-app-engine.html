<h2 class="screen">Introduction</h2>
<div class="intro">
The new Canoo RIA Suite supports deployment to Google App Engine
(GAE) out of the box. On this years first CodeCamp we wanted to try this
new feature out. Where "we" being some Canooies with still limited to
no ULC experience.
</div>

<div class="screen">
<p>For this setup, we used build 5989 of the Canoo RIA Suite and
eclipse 3.5 Galileo with the <a
	href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse.html">GAE
plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Following the general guidelines of chapter 2 in the <a
	href="http://www.canoo.com/ulc/developerzone/ULCApplicationDevelopmentGuide.pdf">UltraLightClient
Application Development Guide</a>, we set up our eclipse workspace (steps 1
- 4) and then deployed our application to GAE:</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2 class="projection">Setting up Canoo RIA Suite</h2>
<ol>
	<li>First we added the external tools ant runner: <pre><code>Run -> External Tools -> External Tools Configurations...</code></pre>
	setting the path to <code>${CANOO_RIA_SUITE_HOME}/addon/generators/build-setup.xml</code>
	</li>
	<li>We created the project with the above created runner.</li>
	<li>Then we imported the server and client projects into our
		eclipse workspace: <pre><code>File -> Import... -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> etc.</code></pre>
		<div class="screen">If nothing else is stated, <i>project</i> in the
		following text, means server project.</div>
	</li>
	<li class="screen">We edited the created files to our likings, and then tested
	the application locally: <pre><code>Run -> Run History -> ${project-name}</code></pre>
	</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Enabling Google App Engine support</h2>

To be able to deploy to Google Apps Engine, the file <code>appengine-web.xml</code>
needs to be created in the <code>WebContent/WEB-INF</code> directory of
the project: 
<pre class="projection code-file">
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">

  <application>application-id</application>
  <version>1</version>
  <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>

</appengine-web-app>
]]>
</pre>
<pre class="screen">
<![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">
	<application>google-app-engine-application-id</application>
	<version>1</version>
	
<!-- Configure java.util.logging
	<system-properties>
		<property name="java.util.logging.config.file" value="WEB-INF/logging.properties"/>
	</system-properties>
 -->
	<sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>
	
</appengine-web-app>
]]>
</pre>

<div class="screen">More info on this file can be found at the
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html">GAE homepage</a>. NOTE!
This file is copied to the war directory by the RIA Suite scripts,
overwriting the file there. The GAE plugin reads its data from the
latter one. Changes made in <code>Project -> Properties -> Google -> App
Engine -> Deployment</code> will therefore be overwritten by the RIA Suite
scripts. See step 7 below.</div>

</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Enabling Google App Engine plugin</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Time to create a GAE WAR! Well, it's really just a war
		directory, but anyway. (WAR files are not yet supported by the GAE
		SDK.)
		<pre>Run -> External Tools -> {project-name}-copy-to-GoogleApp</pre>
		<div class="screen">(It's OK to choose the same directory as the
		project root, which makes step 7 somewhat easier.)</div>
	</li>
	<li>
To actually deploy the application to GAE, the GAE plugin for eclipse does the job for you.
<div class="screen">
(It's also possible to use the appcfg tool that ships with the GAE SDK.)
The wits and bits are well documented at the GAE home page:

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/eclipse.html
</div>

But first the plugin needs to be enabled for the project:
<pre>
Project -> Properties -> Google
</pre>
<ul>
<li>In <code>App Engine</code>, <code>Use Google App Engine</code> needs to be checked.
<div class="screen">(See note in step 5 regarding the entries under Deployment.)</div></li>
<li>
In <code>Web Application</code>, <code>This project has a war directory</code> needs to be checked, and properly configured.
</li>
</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h2>Using the Google App Engine plugin</h2>
After this is done, one can run the application using the GAE plugin, or uplaod it to the GAE website:
 <ul>
 <li>Select
 <pre><code>Run -> Run As -> Web Application</code></pre> 
 to deploy the application in a local jetty instance. The application can
 then be viewed in a browser.
 </li>
 <li>Right clicking on the project, and then selecting
 <pre><code>Google -> Deploy to App Engine</code></pre>
will upload the application to the GAE website.
 </li>
 </ul>
 
Et, voil√†! The application is hosted at GAE.
<div class="screen">
Ok, we did run into a small problem in step 8. Build 5989 wants to deploy 
xulrunner-mac-client.jar, which is to big to be deployed at GAE. Unfortunately the proposed --enable_jar_splitting didn't 
do the trick. However, in our case, the file could safely be deleted from the war and war/WEB-INF/lib directories, 
since our application didn't depend on it.
